        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            For our project, we visualized the percentage of citizens without a high school diploma with average incomes across Washington counties. 
            Free public education is an integral and valuable part of the United States community, and the opportunity to attend school 
            prepares citizens to potentially continue in higher education or enter the professional world. There is a clear correlation 
            between higher average incomes and higher rates of high school graduation, so it is paramount that United States citizens know the 
            importance of graduating high school. To represent income we used proportional symbols on top of a choropleth background for high school graduation rates.
        </p>
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
            We sourced income data from the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2020.S1902?t=Income%20and%20Poverty&g=040XX00US53$1400000&y=2020">US Census </a>
            , and graduation data from from the <a href="https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/d4a6f3c1a45d48b9b31de9ebaf5af4ee_0/explore?location=47.237631%2C-120.811974%2C8.00"> Washington Geospatial Open Data Portal</a>

            The income data was manipulated using Excel to organize each GEOID to ensure it could be joined with a shapefile.

            The graduation data had the field 'Percentage_Without_Diploma' stored as a string rather than a double, 
            so we had to convert that attribute. Additionally, the data was polygon rather than point, so we used QGIS
            to find centroids and map that point coordinate instead.

        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>
            This project was created by four students in the University of Washington's Geography 458: Advanced
            Digital Geographies Winter 2024 course; Jason Simi, Martin Truong, Coby Williams-Gurian, and Camille Zahn.
            
            Jason and Martin focused on the interactive elements, CSS, and overall design of the page. 
            Coby created the choropleth income data map, and finally Camille created the proportional symbols.

        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>
            This project was built upon the template code provided by Bo Zhao. 
            Bo Zhao is an Associate Professor in the University of Washington's Geography department. He also is the director of the Humanistic
            GIS Lab. Zhao's work focuses on how GIS and human experiences interact and affect each other. He aims to use GIS to support marginalized 
            communities and vulnerable populations.
            
            Created using MapBox, Google Fonts, Google Charts, Bootstrap, and QGIS.
            This project is hosted under GitHub pages.
